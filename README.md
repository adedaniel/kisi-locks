# Kisi Locks App

## Built by Daniel Adetola as practical exercise for Kisi

This project was built using React and bootstrapped with Vite, using Material UI for styling and Redux for state management.

## How to run the app in development mode

- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn dev` in the root folder of this project to start the development server.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### Tasks completed

- Allow users to login using email and password
- Retrieve a list of groups for the user
- Show appropriate restriction indicators for groups
- Allow users to search for groups using the search bar
- After clicking on a group, show the list of locks associated with a group.
- Implement assigning a new lock to the group
- Implement de-assigning an assigned lock of the group
- Allow users to logout and go back to the login page

#### Things I would have done if I had more time:

- Show restriction details for locks of a group
- Ensure validation to filter out already selected locks when trying to add a lock to a group
