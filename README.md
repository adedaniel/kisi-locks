# Kisi Locks App

## Built by Daniel Adetola as practical exercise for Kisi

This project was built using React and bootstrapped with Vite, using Material UI for styling and Redux for state management.

## How to run the app in development mode

- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn dev` in the root folder of this project to start the development server.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- Run `yarn test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

The github repository is also located at [https://github.com/adedaniel/kisi-locks](https://github.com/adedaniel/kisi-locks) where I have invited ce07c3 & vramana for review.

#### Things I would have done if I had more time:

- Show restriction details for locks of a group
- Ensure validation to filter out already selected locks when trying to add a lock to a group
